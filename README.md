# SEAT HEAT MONITOR AND CONTROL SYSTEM

* In the places where snow falls or temperature is less,that is around zero degree centigrade, people feel comfort if the car seats are warm while travelling.
* In this project Microcontroller ATMega 328 is used to control seat temperature.
* Program is designed like Heater starts operation only if person is sitting on seat and heater switch is closed.
* When both above conditions are true Temperature sensor starts sensing tempraure of seat.
* If seat temperature is more than 25 deg centigrade,there will be no supply to heater because seat is warm enough.
* If temperature is less than 25 deg PWM output drives the heater driver circuit.
* PWM output and temperature values are inversely proportional i,e lesser the temperature more value of PWM signal will drive the heater.
* For different range of temperature values different PWM value signal is generated.
* When temperature rises above 25 deg,PWM signal will be 0(low).
* All this opeartion is automatic and also temperature range is transmitted to serial output.
